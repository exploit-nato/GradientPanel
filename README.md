# GradientPanel

Some people have asked how to add it to their project,

So you'll download the GradientPanel.cs to your project, then just straight drag'n'drop it into your project folder through Visual Studio,

Then change the namespace to your current project's,

Finally, clean and rebuild the solution, and in the toolbox you should see "GradientPanel" - to which you just drag and drop on your form / user control,

From there, scroll down on properties, and you can change the top and bottom colors to match your preference / theme <3
